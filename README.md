# Sampling-Distributions-and-The-central-limit-theorem

Sampling Distributions. Suppose that we draw all possible samples of size n from a given population. Suppose further that we compute a statistic (e.g., a mean, proportion, standard deviation) for each sample. The probability distribution of this statistic is called a sampling distribution.

Central Limit Theorem. The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

Here in this repo we will work on bootstraping a sample, sampling distribution, law of large numbers, working of central limit theorem.

Here is a glimpse
